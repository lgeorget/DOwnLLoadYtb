DOwnLLoadYtb
============

GUI for [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/), a very useful program by Roberto Garc√≠a Gonzalez et al.

Compilation
-----------

DOwnLLoadYtb is based on Qt 5.3. To compile:

   qmake
   make
  
Cross-compilation to Windows has been tested and proved not so difficult.

Running
-------

You'll need the youtube-dl executable in your path to run DOwnLLoadYtb. The interface is very simple.
It doesn't let you you youtube-dl to its full potential, no options are available for now. Still, it runs
as advertised.
