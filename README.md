DOwnLLoadYtb
============

GUI for [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/), a very useful program by Roberto Garc√≠a Gonzalez et al.

Compilation
-----------

DOwnLLoadYtb is based on [Qt 5.3](http://qt-project.org). To compile:

    qmake
    make
  
Cross-compilation to Windows has been tested. It's not so difficult once you get your toolchain properly configured.

Running
-------

You'll need the `youtube-dl` (or `youtube-dl.exe` on Windows) executable in your path to run DOwnLLoadYtb. The interface is very simple.
It doesn't let you use youtube-dl to its full potential, no options are available for now. Still, it runs
as advertised.
